Hello, this is Fatih Kadir Akın

I'm a passionate software developer living in Istanbul, Turkey, working for Teknasyon as the DevRel Manager. I wrote a book about JavaScript. I love being part of development of web technologies. I like to organize conferences and give talks. I love open source development and I build things on my GitHub profile (here). I love JavaScript and Ruby (and RoR).

💻 What am I doing about Open Source? (GitHub, you're already here)
🐦 What do I think? (Twitter)
🏹 Curriculum vitae, the path of my life (LinkedIn)
Do not forget to view my open source projects below 👇🏻

P.S. To read this intro on terminal, just run npx fka. But why? -- why not? 🤷🏻‍♂️
